# PyBer_Analysis
## Resources
## Overview
The objective of this analysis was to create a data frame to summarize ride sharing data by city type and create a multiple-line graph that displays total weekly driver fares for each city type.
## Results
From the result of the DataFrame summary we can see that the urban city type appears to be the bussiest city type for ride-sharing as it has the highest number of total rides, total drivers, and total fares. We can aslo see that although urban city types have a high about of business they also produce the lowest average fair per ride and per driver.

From the line chart we can again see that the urban city type yields the highest amount of money in fares consistently followed by the suburban and then the rural city type.

## Summary
Based on the data it could be recommened to increase the fair prices of rides in urban areas due to the disparity of fare per ride that drivers receive when compared to rural and suburban city types.It could also be recommended to increase the price of fares for the month of march, as it was the only month to experience in total fare earnings for all city types based on the line graph.

# PyBer_Analysis
## Resources
## Overview
The objective of this analysis was to create a data frame to summarize ride sharing data by city type and create a multiple-line graph that displays total weekly driver fares for each city type.
## Results
From the result of the DataFrame summary we can see that the urban city type appears to be the bussiest city type for ride-sharing as it has the highest number of total rides, total drivers, and total fares. We can aslo see that although urban city types have a high about of business they also produce the lowest average fair per ride and per driver.
